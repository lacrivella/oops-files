# oops-files

What steps I need to take:

-create friend's wrong file structure onto my computer
  make array of random words
  loop through an array of names (about ten)
  createFile function that loops through the array and creates file with random array
  TEST
  
after creating files, rename files
  callbacks? still unsure but probably need it
  renameFunction 

## Goals
Rename all files in a specified based on the content of the file, number in the file name, and the date that the file was last modified.

## Steps
Recreate the problem
  -get random animal species
  -write a bunch of files with animal species
  
Get all the files in the target directory
Rename a file
Get the last modified date of a file
Get a files content
Rename all files with content-oldFileNumber-date
