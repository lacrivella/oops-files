# oops-files

What steps I need to take:

-create friend's wrong file structure onto my computer
  make array of random words
  loop through an array of names (about ten)
  createFile function that loops through the array and creates file with random array
  TEST
  
after creating files, rename files
  callbacks? still unsure but probably need it
  renameFunction
